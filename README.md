# open-pr

Welcome to the open-pr repo.

I wanted to make a repository that is open for the public to practice making PR's to open source software without flooding actual OSS projects and devs with garbage PR's. Here, your garbage PR's are **welcome!!** ...kinda

Follow the simple rules below and your PR will almost surely be merged.

## Rules

### The basics

1. Be respectful - regardless of how you are interacting with this repo, lack of common courtesy will not be tolerated.
2. Family friendly - you can add nearly anything you would like to the project as long as it is free of profanity or offensive material

### Code and content related

3. No malicious code - Obvious attempts to create malicious code such as resource drains or infinite loops will be rejected.
4. Intentional bugs - you may intentionally include a bug in your contribution, but please indicate that you have done so in your PR without describing the bug. I will merge the PR including the bug as long as all other rules are followed. This will allow other users to practice bug reporting and/or fixing the bug via a PR.
5. Do not spam PR's - You may submit multiple PR's as long as they are thoughtful. Do not rapidly submit PR's with little to no content or information.

### Style Guidelines

- Dark mode only
- Simple fonts only
- Must be responsive

## Contribution Ideas

Be creative with contributions. They can be as simple as adding an element to the index.html or as complex as adding an entire directory with a source file in a language of your choice. Some additional ideas could be:

- Add your name and a link to your portfolio to an html file
- Add a rule for this repo.
- Add a contribution idea to this list
- Add a helloworld program to the /hello directory in a langauge that hasn't been added yet.
- Improve the CSS class names or create function classes to eliminate repeating declarations.
- Add to the **Best Pracices** section
